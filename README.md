# A Form Application...

I created this application for a client that needed a substitute for TypeForm as it's too expensive. It receives the data through using React's state then submitting the form would log the data in a private google sheet - where the client can see the logs.

To install dependencies, you would need to run:
```
npm install
```

And to run the application in your local browser:
```
npm run start
```
